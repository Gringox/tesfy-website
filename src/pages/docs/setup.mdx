# Setup

## User identifier

The user identifier or `userId` is used to uniquely identify the users in your experiments and feature flags. Any string could be supplied but is recommended to use a uuid.

The `userId` should be persisted somehow. For example, cookies or local storage.

```javascript
const userId = '676380e0-7793-44d6-9189-eb5868e17a86';
```

## Settings file

The settings file or  `datafile` is just a `json` that defines the configuration of the experiments and features avaliable.

<Alert my={4} status="info" variant="left-accent" overflow="initial">
  <AlertIcon />
  <Text>This process could be automatically done using our <Link href="https://app.tesfy.io" isExternal><Sparkles>web application</Sparkles></Link> for free!</Text>
</Alert>

Ideally this file should be hosted somewhere outside your application, so it could be fetched during boostrap or every certain time. This will allow you to make changes to this file without deploying the whole application.

```javascript
const datafile = {
  experiments: {
    'experiment-1': {
      id: 'experiment-1',
      percentage: 90,
      variations: [{
        id: '0',
        percentage: 50
      }, {
        id: '1',
        percentage: 50
      }]
    },
    'experiment-2': {
      id: 'experiment-2',
      percentage: 100,
      variations: [{
        id: '0',
        percentage: 100
      }],
      audience: { // jsonLogic
        '==' : [{ var : 'countryCode' }, 'us']
      }
    }
  },
  features: {
    'feature-1': {
      id: 'feature-1',
      percentage: 50
    }
  }
};
```

The format to define audiences is [jsonLogic](http://jsonlogic.com/) which allow you to build complex rules as JSON. For example, you can nest rules to target users that are older than 32 years old and are located in ðŸ‡»ðŸ‡ª


```javascript
const rules = {
  and: [
    { '<': [{ var: 'age' }, 32] },
    { '==': [{ var: 'countryCode' }, 've'] }
  ]
};
```
